What is Python,and why is it popular ?\n","\n","   -\n","  Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language designed for simplicity and versatility. Created by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991, Python emphasizes code readability with its clean and straightforward syntax. It's widely used for a variety of applications, from web development to data analysis and artificial intelligence."],"metadata":{"id":"oA87LBncN5KQ"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["2. What is an interpreter in Python ?\n","\n","   - An interpreter in Python is a software program that reads and executes Python code directly, line by line. Unlike a compiler, which translates the entire program into machine code before execution, the Python interpreter translates and runs the code on the fly. This process is what makes Python an interpreted language."],"metadata":{"id":"hj9S7nVGQWvT"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["3. What are pre-defined keywords in Python ?\n","  - Pre-defined keywords in Python are reserved words that have a specific meaning and purpose in the Python language.

Why are lists mutable, but tuples are immutable ?\n","  - The difference in mutability between lists and tuples in Python is a deliberate design choice based on their intended use cases. Here's an explanation:\n","\n","Lists: Mutable\n","Reason: Lists are designed to be dynamic and flexible, allowing modification of their content after creation. This includes operations like adding, removing, or updating elements.\n","Use Case: Lists are used when you need a data structure to manage collections that can change over time.\n","Implementation: Internally, lists are implemented with a resizable array.
